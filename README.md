# CS 493 Final Project

In this course, a final programming project will take the place of formal exams to test your understanding of the material. The final project will involve working with a team of 3-4 people to implement a complete RESTful API for an application called Tarpaulin.

# Tarpaulin
The application for which you’ll write an API for this project is Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that’s an "alternative" to Canvas. In particular, Tarpaulin allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses they’re teaching/taking. It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions to those assignments.

The Tarpaulin API you implement must support all of the endpoints described in the Tarpaulin OpenAPI specification. Importantly, you are free to implement the endpoints described in the OpenAPI specification however you see fit. For example, you may use whatever database you want, and you may design your API architecture to meet your own needs.
